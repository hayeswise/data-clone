## dataClone â‡’ <code>Object</code>
Creates a deep clone of the object's data. By default, any properties begining with an underscore or are functionsare ignored. Only the object's own enumerable properties are considered - properities in the prototype chain are ignored. The ignored types and ignored properties can be changed by pushing new values into, or completely replacingthe values of, properites IGNORE_TYPES and IGONRE_PROPERTY_NAMES.

**Kind**: global variable  
**Returns**: <code>Object</code> - An object that is a deep "data" clone of the object's data.
